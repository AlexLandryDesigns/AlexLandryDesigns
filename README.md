My name is Alex Landry, my GitHub name is @AlexLandryDesigns.

I'm currently a student at Lone Star College in Houston, TX getting my Associate's Degree in Mobile Application & Web Development. I'm transitioning from Graphic Design into a programming field.

The languages I've previously used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have since learned introductory knowledge of Python, Regular Expressions, and I'm currently doing a course with Java.

From my Graphic Design days, I have knowlege of and use the CS6 line of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.
